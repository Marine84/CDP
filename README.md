### Module

MODULE 2.1: VERSION CONTROL WITH GIT


### Home Task

As a basis for this home task, you’ll need to create a git repository on git.epam.com/github.com. 

## 1. Git base actions:
*     Clone remote repository using SSH keys;
*     Create 3 commits in “master” branch;
*     Create new “develop” branch and push 2 commits to it;
*     Merge “develop” branch to “master” branch;

## 2. Git advanced actions:
*     Add 2 additional commits to "develop" branch, and 1 additional commit to “master”. Rebase "develop" with new commits from "master";
*     Add 2 additional commits to “develop” branch. Cherry-pick the first commit to “master”. Revert the second commit; 
*     Together with your mentor emulate ‘merge conflict’ situation and resolve this.
